# HW1 
This program calculates the product of two different matrices using 'p' threads.

The matrix's result dimesion is 'n'rows and 'n' columns.

one-dimensional decomposition consists in partitioning the n rows of the matrix result

matrix between the p threads. Thus, each thread will compute a block of n/p rows of the matricx result.
